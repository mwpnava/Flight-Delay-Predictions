## Flight Delays Predictions ML Model

### About this project:

Delayed flights can have significant negative economic impacts on airlines, airports, and passengers which motivates the creation of more robust 
delay management programs like the existing ground delay program. Our project consists of two parts: analyzing flight & weather datasets, 
and predicting flight delays. One dataset has a yearâ€™s worth of all US flight delay info [retrieved from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv/) and the other dataset has been gathered 
by web-scraping [weather site](https://www.wunderground.com/history/). We implemented a model to predict weather-induced airline delays using ML algorithm random Forest.
